# Vision

## Problem
Backtesting, and analysing marketdata, can be expensive. To minimize cost, im builing a data fetcher in order to collect my own data.

## Target User
This is for me.

## Why Now
I want to learn how to use postGres database, in combination with python and yfinance.

## Differentiator
Using data APIs costs alot of money. Using other services for market analysis might be just as good. But I want my own products, and I want to learn.

## Non-Goals
No analtyical tools. Just pure data fetching, and storing it in postGres DB.
